#in Python, it seems that you dont have to specify the type of an obeject
#you just have to say the name and give it a value like this:
number = 2
this_is_a_float = 1.1
this_is_a_string = "String"
#you can also do operations with objects
one = 1
two = 2
three = one + two
print "The answer is", three
